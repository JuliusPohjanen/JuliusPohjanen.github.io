      <h1>Banksimul project</h1>
      <p>The banksimul or ATM-simulator was a program done using mostly object oriented programming</p>
      <p>The program it self included a RFID reader and a few of keys to go along with the reader. The keys simulated the fysical bank card.</p>
      <p>The program could read the individual cards and they were included in their own bank account. There was a database that held all of the cards and customer information</p>
      <p>My part in the project was to make the functionality of the ATM, such as withdrawing money, checking the balance, and reading the bank card.</p>
      <p>Along with the features for the atm's functionality, I did make most of the backend of the project myself</p>
      <p>The project was challenging, but very fun to do.</p>
