## Project Goals

The goals for this projects are to learn about how to create a simple web page with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Some of the goals and features were provided by the course's evaluation criteria. 

My website is a portfolio, where i can quickly show what projects I have been in and in what capacity.
Some of the things in the course's evaluation criteria. wouldn't have suited the overall image and function of the website.
I am not going to put random things, such as buttons to tell the time, just for the course's evaluation.

the project's main goal was to make a simple portfolio website that I could show at a recruitment event. 
It didn't need the extra bells and whistles of the evaluation criteria although I could have done them. For the sake of
a greater course number.
