## Course Evaluation

### File Locations
- HTML files are on the front page of the porject's github page
- CSS file is here https://github.com/JuliusPohjanen/JuliusPohjanen.github.io/blob/main/css/style.css
- JavaScript scripts files are here https://github.com/JuliusPohjanen/JuliusPohjanen.github.io/tree/main/assets/scripts

In my fair oppinion, this project should get me a course number atlest between 2 and 3. 
Judging by the Moodle evaluation criteria https://jukkapne.github.io/WebOhjelmoinninPerusteet/, atleast these criteria have been met.

  HTML
- from 1/5 through 5/5 parts of the HTML criteria I have implemented. HTML files are on front page of the porject's github page.
  
  
  CSS
- from 1/5 through 5/5 parts of the CSS criteria I have implemented. CSS file https://github.com/JuliusPohjanen/JuliusPohjanen.github.io/blob/main/css/style.css
  
  
  JS
- 1/5 part is done, because there are simple interactions in the JavaScript. Files are here https://github.com/JuliusPohjanen/JuliusPohjanen.github.io/blob/main/assets/scripts/
- 2/5 part is done, because there are multiple event listeners for the opened images in project galleries. File is here https://github.com/JuliusPohjanen/JuliusPohjanen.github.io/blob/main/assets/scripts/timer_scripts.js
  
  
  Asynchronous Operations
- 1/5 part is done, because there is a timeout function that returns the user back to the front page in 5 minutes.
  When 1 minute is left it alerts the user. File is here https://github.com/JuliusPohjanen/JuliusPohjanen.github.io/blob/main/assets/scripts/timer_scripts.js
- 2/5 part is done, because there is a API fetch for weather information. File is here https://github.com/JuliusPohjanen/JuliusPohjanen.github.io/blob/main/assets/scripts/Weather_API_script.js
- 3/5 part is done, because the weather data is being displayed here https://github.com/JuliusPohjanen/JuliusPohjanen.github.io/blob/main/WeatherInformation.html

## Project Goals

The goals for this projects are to learn about how to create a simple web page with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Some of the goals and features were provided by the course's evaluation criteria. 

My website is a portfolio, where i can quickly show what projects I have been in and in what capacity.
Some of the things in the course's evaluation criteria. wouldn't have suited the overall image and function of the website.
I am not going to put random things, such as buttons to tell the time, just for the course's evaluation.

the project's main goal was to make a simple portfolio website that I could show at a recruitment event. 
It didn't need the extra bells and whistles of the evaluation criteria although I could have done them. For the sake of
a greater course number.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

- Side menu that has the website navigation (can be opened and closed).
- Images in the website can be opened and closed. Plus opened pictures can be navigated between.
  Image navigation was done with event listeners
- Responsive design, for the most part.
- The website has an 5 minute timer that redirects the user to the front page in 5 minutes if nothing is done.
- The timer gives an popup message if one minute is left.

## Future Plans

Plan for the future of this website project is to add to it in the future and make it better as time goes on.
